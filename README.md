# Foolin2day is...

Simple program to troll ur friends!
I do not take responsibility for infecting computers, I am just providing the source code.
Coded 4 fun in like 30 minutes or hour idk.
prolly shit code, idc.
This is the shittiest shit ive ever done. please do NOT ask me about this.

# What do Foolin2day doin??
In general, this program(s) do the same thing, scroll through “events” one after another at random. And... basically that's all! But this program has a couple of editions that can be discussed here below:
There's a bunch of versions of Foolin2day.

Python Console Version: Just a program that shows what events are going on now and how long the next event will be, !coded on python!

Python Default Version: Same program, but without console and running on "quiet". !coded on python!

# Events
- "shake_cursor" is just shaking cursor.
- "play_error_sound" is playing Asterisk sound.
- "type_random_text" is making your computer typing one of this texts: "Oops!", "What's happening?", "Glitch in the matrix!", "Why so serious?", "Is anyone there?".
- "random_mouse_clicks" is moving ur cursor at random points and clicks.
- "random_window_minimize" is minimizing 3 active windows at one event drop.
- "open_and_close_calculator" is speaks for itself, but my shit code making it running "Run" window, types "calc", and presses Alt + F4. Pretty shit code. ik.
- "add_desktop_icon" is creating 3 *.txt files.
- "block_taskbar" is creating the big black (coc) rectangle at the bottom so its overrides taskbar.
- "open_random_emoticon" popping da window with one of this emoticons: "¯\\_(ツ)_/¯", "(ಠ_ಠ)", "(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻", "(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ", "(ಥ﹏ಥ)".

# Additional info about Foolin2day
- "Ctrl + C" to stop
- After "Ctrl + C" stopping, program is deleting those "add_desktop_icon" 3 *.txt files.
- i think NONE of this events will work out of windows but you can check it.
